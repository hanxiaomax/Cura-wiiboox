Development
* Added an expert parameter for the wipe tower size, and made brim go around the wipe tower
* Added experimental support for printing with the Doodle3D WiFi box
* Updated object boundaries for multi-object prints, allows for tighter fitting of objects on the build platform
* Updated time-estimate to greatly improve accuracy of the estimate.
* Fixed problem with retractions not happening when they should.
* Added keyboard control for the 3D window to look around with cursor keys.

Ultimaker2 - Firmware update - 13.12
* Fixed the problem where aborting a print did not always home the head.
* Fixed bug in acceleration planning causing slow moves on rare occasions.
* Disable the normal menus during USB printing, and support for USB based menus.
* Disable stepper drivers after print is finished or aborted, so you can manually move the head.
* Expert feature: Support M907 for setting the motor current.

* Slightly tweaked the filament change procedure so there is less chance of a blob staying behind.
* Slightly tweaked the SD-Card error problems.
* Added LED settings to Tune menu
* Start heating the nozzles when the bed is nearing its final temperature, so the nozzles do not sit hot.

* Added imageToMesh tool to load images as 3D height maps
* Fixed Z support distance when using "everywhere" support.
* Updated to new version of clipper to fix rare slicing bugs that resulted in odd paths.

* Change how the fan is handled on lower layer to improve UM2 printing.
* Fix that retraction is enabled when selecting UM2 or RepRap.
* Scale down very large models, or scale up very tiny models automagicly.
* Fixed skirt and brim to go around the support instead of under it.
* Added spiralize mode
